Sure! Here is a code in python to add two numbers:

```python
# storing two numbers in variables
num1 = 5
num2 = 7

# adding two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# printing the sum of two numbers
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
```

Explanation:

1. We first store the two numbers that we want to add in variables `num1` and `num2`.
2. We then add `num1` and `num2` and store the result in variable `sum`.
3. Finally, we print the result using the `print()` function by combining strings and variables with the '+' operator.
